/**
 * The floor behind a door — a different shape for every kind of place.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * All thirteen sites opened onto `makeTestMap` — the same hand-authored 30x30
 * room, every time. Walk into a city, a mine, a drowned chapel or an industrial
 * ward and you got the identical floor plan, which makes the region's thirteen
 * destinations one destination with thirteen doors. Reported from play as the
 * points of interest all being the same.
 *
 * A place's IDENTITY at this scale is its SHAPE. Long straight galleries read
 * as a mine before a single sprite is drawn; an open plaza with blocks in it
 * reads as a town; scattered fragments read as a ruin. So each site kind gets a
 * generator, and the generator is the identity.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * FLOOR AND WALL, AND NOTHING ELSE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `TILE_SPRITES` in the renderer deliberately has no entry for either, so every
 * room this produces draws correctly the day it is written — the flat-interior
 * rule paying for itself a second time. Four new layouts cost zero assets.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * CONNECTIVITY IS PROVEN, NOT HOPED FOR
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Every generator here finishes by carving from the spawn to anything it
 * stranded, so "can the player reach the far side" is a property of the
 * algorithm. A sealed pocket in a hand-authored map is a bug somebody notices;
 * in a generated one it is a bug that appears one run in fifty and cannot be
 * reproduced from a description.
 *
 * PURE, and seeded from shared/rng.ts with labelled draws, so a floor is
 * reproducible from the realm that opened it.

 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT A ROOM IS MADE OF. Two codes, and it is a SUBSTITUTION, not a generator.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Thirteen destinations were one destination with thirteen doors, then `shape`
 * made them four; they were still every one of them the same grey box, because
 * every interior in the game is built out of exactly two tile codes and the
 * player has been looking at those two codes since M1.
 *
 * The palette is applied as a POST-PASS over the finished grid rather than
 * threaded into the carvers, and that is the whole safety argument: the
 * generator runs unchanged, draws the same numbers off the same seeded stream in
 * the same order, and produces the same walkable cells bit for bit. Only the two
 * codes it wrote are renamed on the way out. A room cannot become unreachable by
 * being repainted, and `sitemap.test.ts` asserts exactly that — the walkable
 * index set is identical to the FLOOR/WALL build for every shape and palette.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES CARRY A REAL RULE, checked by that same test rather than trusted:
 * the floor must be `isWalkable` and the wall must not be, or a repaint would
 * quietly change where a body may stand.
 *
 * AND IT IS FREE. Every code any palette names already has a PNG on disk and a
 * `tileFill` colour — six of them (GREEN, SOOT, RAIL, WORKS, TERRACE, CIVIC) are
 * finished art that until now drew nothing anywhere in the game, because their
 * codes appear on no overworld row and in no interior.
